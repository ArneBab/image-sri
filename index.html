<p>This page was originally created by me (Beardog): <a href="https://chaoswebs.net/image-sri/">https://chaoswebs.net/</a>.</p>

<p><a href='http://www.draketo.de/'>Arne Babenhauserheide</a> added a check for whether the browser supports <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SRI/">Subresource-Integrity (SRI)</a> at all. If you see <a href="no-sri.png">no-sri.png</a> instead of the <a href="wtactics-raven.png">raven</a>, then your browser does not verify the Subresource-Integrity. If you see <a href="failed.png">failed.png</a>, then the Subresource-Integrity check failed. Read the source for details.</p>

<p>The success-image is <a href="wtactics-raven-large.png">raven from WTactics</a> (scaled and cropped), licensed <a href="./README">under GPLv2 or later</a> and created for the <a href="http://wtactics.org/">WTactics project</a>.</p>

<p>This page is also <a href='https://github.com/beardog108/image-sri/'>on Github</a>.</p>
